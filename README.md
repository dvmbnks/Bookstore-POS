This system is a true exemplar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, elegantly embracing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The backbone of the system lies in the dynamic use of vectors, ensuring the seamless management of an ever-evolving inventory. Each book is encapsulated within a class, neatly housing its details, while file manipulation gracefully preserves and retrieves data for persistent use. Unit Testing was utilized to ensure all functions run as designed. Use of Pointers exemplifies a deep understanding of memory management. The strategic use of pointers adds a layer of efficiency, ensuring that resources are allocated and deallocated with precision. It's like you've crafted a sophisticated ballet of data, where each move is intentional and graceful. The combination of OOP, dynamic vectors, file manipulation, unit testing, and pointers develops a robust system.
